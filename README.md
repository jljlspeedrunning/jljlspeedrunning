Hi, GitHub! I am JLJL (Speedrunning or Programming, depending on what I'm doing).
- I'm a speedrunner of Super Mario Odyssey and some other games (and I'm decent at them, too). https://www.speedrun.com/users/JLJL
- I'm a terrible speedcuber with my PB being 13 seconds.
- I have some experience with Python, JavaScript, C++, HTML. I have some scripting knowledge, using Python, Bash, PowerShell, and last and definitely least, CMD.
- I have (a little bit of) Linux skills, using WSL2, an old laptop with Linux on it, and VMs.
- I'm a newbie hacker, so please understand.
