Hi, GitHub! I am JLJL (Speedrunning or Programming, depending on what I'm doing).
- I'm a speedrunner of Super Mario Odyssey and some other games (and I'm decent at them, too). https://www.speedrun.com/users/JLJL
- I'm a terrible speedcuber averaging around 15 seconds.
- I have some experience with Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, HTML, Typescript, Go, and Rust. I have some scripting knowledge, using Python, Bash, PowerShell, and last and definitely least, CMD.exe.
- Windows used to be my main OS for coding, as the only Linux device I had was an ancient laptop that wouldn't even boot Windows 11. However, I installed Linux on my gaming PC, so now Linux is my main. My favorite desktop distro is Manjaro (server distro is Ubuntu Server).
- I'm a newbie hacker, so please understand if I don't get certain concepts.
